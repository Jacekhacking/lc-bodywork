      <p>
        FAQ -What is Orthopedic Assessment in Massage Therapy?(And why do I need
        it?) Assessment is an evaluation process; a systematic process of
        gathering information. Rather than treatment based on assumptions, I use
        this information to develop clinical reasoning for your sessions.
        Assessment performs the following important functions: *Indicates which
        tissues are most likely involved. *Indicates the status of the involved
        tissues. *Directs the choice of most appropriate treatment. *Helps
        determine progress towards treatment goals. *Determines if a
        client&#39;s condition falls within my scope of practice and expertise.
        -Tips? Tips are never expected. My rates cover the cost of doing
        business with you. Massage Therapy is my profession and I am a provider
        in your healthcare journey, like a chiropractor or dentist would be. The
        best tip is a referral! Or leave a review online: link here SERVICES
